  abstract	= "{The authors are interested in the Dirichlet problem for
		  second-order elliptic equations in non-convex
		  three-dimensional polygonal domains. The equations have
		  constant coefficients. Such problems can exhibit
		  singularities along edges and at corners. Unless properly
		  treated, these singularities will diminish the rate of
		  convergence of finite element solutions. In the current
		  paper, the authors devise a mesh refinement strategy based
		  on singularity exponents that results in optimal
		  convergence rates when used with piecewise linear shape
		  functions. The mesh refinement is anisotropic in the sense
		  that the aspect ratio of the mesh is not necessarily
		  bounded. The authors present some new local interpolation
		  error estimates employing anisotropic weighting functions
		  to support their convergence results. \par The first-named
		  author and his colleagues have investigated similar
		  problems before. The present paper is the first to employ
		  the anisotropic mesh refinement strategy for problems with
		  both edge and corner singularities in arbitrary polygonal
		  domains. A numerical example shows that optimal convergence
		  can be achieved in practice and is a substantial
		  improvement over uniform mesh refinement for a problem with
		  a so-called Fichera corner.}",

		  curves for an extensive range of plate separations are
		  obtained, and, when the plate separation is large compared
		  to the Stokes layer thickness, the linear stability
		  properties of the Stokes layer in a semi-infinite fluid are
		  recovered. A detailed analysis of the damping rates of
		  disturbances to the basic flow provides a plausible
		  explanation of why several previous studies of the problem
		  have failed to detect any linear instability of the flow.
		  
		  To compare more faithfully with experimental work, the
		  techniques used for the channel problem are modified to
		  allow the determination of neutral curves for axisymmetric
		  disturbances to purely oscillatory flow in a circular pipe.
		  Critical Reynolds numbers for the pipe flow tend to be
		  smaller than their counterparts for the channel case, but
		  the smallest critical value is still almost twice the
		  experimentally reported result.}",

		  Zbl 0377.76040)] the first author investigated the linear
		  stability of flow in a straight pipe whose cross-section
		  was an ellipse, of small ellipticity $e$, by regarding the
		  flow as a perturbation of Poiseuille flow in a circular
		  pipe. That paper contained some serious errors which we
		  correct herein. We show analytically that for the most
		  important mode $n = 1$, for which the circular problem has
		  a double eigenvalue $c_0$ as the `swirl' can be in either
		  direction, the ellipticity splits the double eigenvalue
		  into two separate eigenvalues $c_0 \pm e^2 c_{12}$, to
		  leading order, when the cross-sectional area of the pipe is
		  kept fixed. The imaginary part of $c_{12}$ is non-zero and
		  so the ellipticity always makes the flow less stable. This
		  specific problem is generic to a much wider class of fluid
		  dynamical problems which are made less stable when the
		  symmetry group of the dynamical system is reduced from
		  $S^1$ to $Z_2$.}",

		  the most popular current method for computing visco-plastic
		  fluid flows. They are however generally used in an ad hoc
		  manner. Here we examine convergence of regularised
		  solutions to those of the corresponding exact models, in
		  both mathematical and physical senses. Mathematically, the
		  aim is to give practical guidance as to the order of error
		  that one might expect for different regularisations and for
		  different types of flow. Our theoretical results are
		  illustrated with a number of computed example flows showing
		  the orders of error predicted. Physically, the question is
		  whether or not the regularised solutions behave in the same
		  way as the exact solutions, qualitatively as well as
		  quantitatively. We show that there are flows for which
		  regularisation methods will generate their maximum errors,
		  e.g. lubrication-type flows. In this context, we also
		  consider the effects of regularisation on problems of
		  hydrodynamic stability. For broad classes of problems,
		  stability characteristics of the flow are incorrectly
		  predicted by the use of viscosity regularisation methods.}",

		  viscous potential flow. The analysis leads to an explicit
		  dispersion relation in which the effects of surface tension
		  and viscosity on the normal stress are not neglected, but
		  the effect of shear stresses is. Formulas for the growth
		  rates, wave speeds and neutral stability curve are given in
		  general, and are applied to experiments in air-water flows.
		  The effects of surface tension are always important and
		  determine the stability limits for the cases in which the
		  volume fraction of gas is not too small. The stability
		  criterion for viscous potential flow is expressed by a
		  critical value of relative velocity. The maximum critical
		  value is when the viscosity ratio is equal to the density
		  ratio; surprisingly, the neutral curve for this viscous
		  fluid is the same as the neutral curve for inviscid
		  fluids.}",

		  particularly well suited to modelling flows of many fluids
		  at high pressures, and is relevant to several flow
		  situations involving lubricants. Fluid models in which the
		  viscosity depends on pressure have not received the
		  attention, and we consider unidirectional and
		  two-dimensional flows of such fluids here. We note that
		  solutions can have markedly different characteristics than
		  the corresponding solutions for classical Navier-Stokes
		  fluid. It is shown that unidirectional flows corresponding
		  to Couette or Poiseuille flow are possible only for special
		  forms of viscosity. Furthermore, we show that interesting
		  non-unique solutions are possible for flow between moving
		  plates, which has no counterpart in the classical
		  Navier-Stokes theory. We also study, numerically,
		  two-dimensional flows that are technologically significant:
		  flows between rotating coaxial or eccentric cylinders, and
		  a flow across a slot. The solutions provide interesting
		  departures from those for the classical Navier-Stokes
		  fluid.}",

		  This follows by using a perturbation approach and by
		  assuming an expansion of displacement in a small parameter

		  the zeroth-order axial displacement, similarly to the
		  analysis of the Poiseuille flow. The small parameter

		  used to described the behaviour of the ERF, when the fluid

		  parabolic mean profile. It is found that the growth of
		  disturbances with large but finite streamwise wavelength
		  exhibits a very rich structure of temporal evolution
		  depending on the particular initial condition chosen. The
		  objective of part II is to study the laminar-turbulence
		  transition.\par Direct numerical simulations in conjunction
		  with a bypass mechanism are performed around the Reynolds
		  numbers at which sustained turbulence is obtained in
		  laboratory. The intermodal energy transfer and mean flow
		  interactions are analyzed. It is shown that the transient
		  growth mechanism persists in the nonlinear development with
		  the evolution attributable to the linear mechanism. The
		  physical aspects of flow simulations are consistent with
		  puff formation.}",

		  However, in an important instance that appeals to the
		  approximation (elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL)), the
		  liquid lubricant is subjected to extremely high pressures
		  and the assumption that the viscosity is independent of the
		  pressure no longer holds. On the contrary, pressure
		  dependence of viscosity is severe and the viscosity can
		  increase by several orders of magnitude due to pressure
		  increase. Nevertheless, in the current literature the
		  pressure dependence of viscosity in the derivation of the
		  governing equations for EHL is only recognized a
		  posteriori, that is, after the Reynolds equation has been
		  stated under the assumption of constant viscosity.\par A
		  consistent derivation of the equations of EHL that takes
		  into account the pressure dependence of viscosity right
		  from the outset leads to additional and hitherto neglected
		  terms in the governing equations. Consequently,
		  construction of a single pressure equation, analogous to
		  the Reynolds equation, is no longer possible without
		  additional, drastic, assumptions.\par In this study,we
		  provide a consistent derivation of the equations of motion
		  for EHL and, with additional, simplifying assumptions,
		  derive a modified Reynolds equation. We then provide a
		  comparison between the solutions to the classical equation
		  of Reynolds's and our modified equation. The modified

		  significantly higher viscosities, than the classical

  abstract	= {{Embryos of different species of vertebrate share a common
		  organisation and often look similar. Adult differences
		  among species become more apparent through divergence at
		  later stages. Some authors have suggested that members of
		  most or all vertebrate clades pass through a virtually
		  identical, conserved stage. This idea was promoted by
		  Haeckel, and has recently been revived in the context of
		  claims regarding the universality of developmental
		  mechanisms. Thus embryonic resemblance at the tailbud stage
		  has been linked with a conserved pattern of developmental
		  gene expression - the zootype. Haeckel's drawings of the
		  external morphology of various vertebrates remain the most
		  comprehensive comparative data purporting to show a
		  conserved stage. However, their accuracy has been
		  questioned and only a narrow range of species was
		  illustrated. In view of the current widespread interest in
		  evolutionary developmental tal biology, and especially in
		  the conservation of developmental mechanisms,
		  re-examination of the extent of variation in vertebrate
		  embryos is long overdue, We present here the first review
		  of the external morphology of tailbud embryos, illustrated
		  with original specimens from a wide range of vertebrate
		  groups, We find that embryos at the tailbud stage - thought
		  to correspond to a conserved stage - show variations in
		  form due to allometry, heterochrony, and differences in
		  body plan and somite number. These variations foreshadow
		  important differences in adult body form. Contrary to
		  recent claims that all vertebrate embryos pass through a
		  stage when they are the same size, we find a greater than
		  10-fold variation in greatest length at the tailbud stage.
		  Our survey seriously undermines the credibility of
		  Haeckel's drawings, which depict not a conserved stage for
		  vertebrates, but a stylised amniote embryo. In fact, the
		  taxonomic level of greatest resemblance among vertebrate
		  embryos is below the subphylum. The wide variation in
		  morphology among vertebrate embryos is difficult to
		  reconcile with the idea of a phyogenetically-conserved
		  tailbud stage, and suggests that at least some
		  developmental mechanisms are not highly constrained by the
		  zootype, Our study also highlights the dangers of drawing
		  general conclusions about vertebrate development from
		  studies of gene expression in a small number of laboratory
		  species.}},

		  concerns the distribution of primitive versus advanced

		  This controversy has major implications for evolutionary

		  addressed the issue with his Biogenetic Law, and his embryo
		  drawings functioned as supporting data. We re-examine
		  Haeckel's work and its significance for modern efforts to
		  develop a rigorous comparative framework for developmental
		  studies. Haeckel's comparative embryology was evolutionary
		  but non-quantitative. It was based on developmental
		  sequences, and treated heterochrony as a sequence change.
		  It is not always clear whether he believed in
		  recapitulation of single characters or entire stages. The
		  Biogenetic Law is supported by several recent studies - if
		  applied to single characters only. Haeckel's important but
		  overlooked alphabetical analogy of evolution and
		  development is an advance on von Baer. Haeckel recognized
		  the evolutionary diversity in early embryonic stages, in
		  line with modern thinking. He did not necessarily advocate
		  the strict form of recapitulation and terminal addition
		  commonly attributed to him. Haeckel's much-criticized
		  embryo drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses,
		  teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some
		  criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more
		  tendentious. In opposition to Haeckel and his embryo
		  drawings, Wilhelm His made major advances towards
		  developing a quantitative comparative embryology based on
		  morphometrics. Unfortunately His's work in this area is
		  largely forgotten. Despite his obvious flaws, Haeckel can
		  be seen as the father of a sequence-based phylogenetic
		  embryology.},

  abstract	= {There has been a resurgence of interest in comparative
		  embryology. It is now important to be able to compare gene
		  expression in different species at similar developmental
		  stages. One phenomenon which may make it difficult to
		  compare embryos in this way is heterochrony-a change in
		  developmental timing during evolution. It is not clear
		  whether heterochrony can affect the intermediate stages of
		  embryonic development, when many important genes involved
		  in pattern formation are expressed. A prevalent view is
		  that these so-called phylotypic stages are resistant to
		  evolutionary change because they are when the body plan is
		  laid down. Haeckel's famous drawings, which show different
		  vertebrates developing from virtually identical
		  somite-stage embryos, are still used to support this idea.
		  I have reexamined the morphological data relating to
		  developmental timing in somite-stage embryos. The data
		  reveal striking patterns of heterochrony during vertebrate
		  evolution. These shifts in developmental timing have
		  strongly affected the phylotypic stage, which is therefore
		  poorly conserved and is more appropriately described as the
		  phylotypic period. This is contrary to the impression
		  created by Haeckel's drawings, which I show to be
		  inaccurate and misleading. The study of gene expression in
		  embryos which shown heterochrony could give important
		  insights into evolutionary and developmental mechanisms.

		  an isotropic inhomogeneous compressible annular right
		  circular cylinder. Current approaches to homogenization
		  that appeal to an equivalence in the stored energies could
		  lead to serious errors in the estimate for stresses in a
		  inhomogeneous body as stresses depend on the derivatives of
		  the stored energy with respect to the deformation gradient.
		  This is a serious drawback as many a time failures are
		  determined by the stresses. The study demonstrates that, in
		  particular, great caution should be exercised in
		  homogenization, especially if an inhomogeneous body is to
		  be approximated by a homogeneous body belonging to the same
		  class. Comparison of local measures, such as stresses,
		  reveal that their values in the case of the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart can be both
		  qualitatively and quantitatively far apart. Even the
		  differences in global measures like the axial load, torque,
		  etc., are found to be significant between the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart. It is also shown that
		  the material parameters characterizing the homogenous
		  approximation gleaned from correlations from different
		  experiments, performed on the same inhomogeneous body, can
		  be quite different. }

  abstract	= { ABSTRACT In most work on the theory of stability of
		  laminar flow, infinitesimal disturbances only have been
		  considered, so that only the initial growth of the
		  disturbance has been determined. It is the object of the
		  present paper to extend the theory to larger amplitudes and
		  to study the mechanics of disturbance growth with the
		  inherent non-linearity of the hydrodynamical system taken
		  into account.The Reynolds stress (where averages are taken
		  with respect to some suitable space coordinate) is the
		  fundamental consequence of the non-linearity, and its
		  effects can be anticipated as follows. Initially a
		  disturbance grows exponentially with time according to the
		  linear theory, but eventually it reaches such a size that
		  the transport of momentum by the finite fluctuations is
		  appreciable and the associated mean stress (the Reynolds
		  stress) then has an appreciable effect on the mean flow.
		  This distortion of the mean flow modifies the rate of
		  transfer of energy from the mean flow to the disturbance
		  and, since this energy transfer is the cause of the growth
		  of the disturbance, there is a modification of the rate of
		  growth of the latter.It is suggested that, in many cases,
		  an equilibrium state may be possible in which the rate of
		  transfer of energy from the (distorted) mean flow to the
		  disturbance balances precisely the rate of viscous
		  dissipation of the energy of disturbance. A theory based on
		  certain assumptions about the energy flow is given to
		  describe both the growth of the disturbance and the final
		  equilibrium state, and application is made to the cases of
		  Poiseuille flow between parallel planes and flow between
		  rotating cylinders. The distorted mean flow in the
		  equilibrium state can be calculated and from this, in the
		  latter case, the torque required to maintain the cylinders
		  in motion. Good agreement is obtained with G. I.
		  Taylor&apos;s measurements of the torque for the case when
		  the inner cylinder rotates and the outer cylinder is at
		  rest. }

  abstract	= {Photographs by J. E. Mack of the first atomic explosion in
		  New Mexico were measured, and the radius, R, of the
		  luminous globe or 'ball of fire' which spread out from the
		  centre was determined for a large range of values of t, the
		  time measured from the start of the explosion. The
		  relationship predicted in part I, namely, that
		  R$^{\frac{5}{2}}$ would be proportional to t, is
		  surprisingly accurately verified over a range from R=20 to
		  185 m. The value of R$^{\frac{5}{2}}$t$^{-1}$ so found was
		  used in conjunction with the formulae of part I to estimate
		  the energy E which was generated in the explosion. The
		  amount of this estimate depends on what value is assumed
		  for $\gamma $, the ratio of the specific heats of air. Two
		  estimates are given in terms of the number of tons of the
		  chemical explosive T.N.T. which would release the same
		  energy. The first is probably the more accurate and is
		  16,800 tons. The second, which is 23,700 tons, probably
		  overestimates the energy, but is included to show the
		  amount of error which might be expected if the effect of
		  radiation were neglected and that of high temperature on
		  the specific heat of air were taken into account. Reasons
		  are given for believing that these two effects neutralize
		  one another. After the explosion a hemispherical volume of
		  very hot gas is left behind and Mack's photographs were
		  used to measure the velocity of rise of the glowing centre
		  of the heated volume. This velocity was found to be 35
		  m./sec. Until the hot air suffers turbulent mixing with the
		  surrounding cold air it may be expected to rise like a
		  large bubble in water. The radius of the 'equivalent
		  bubble' is calculated and found to be 293 m. The vertical
		  velocity of a bubble of this radius is
		  ${\textstyle\frac{2}{3}}\ \surd $(g29300) or 35$\cdot $7
		  m./sec. The agreement with the measured value, 35 m./sec.,
		  is better than the nature of the measurements permits one
		  to expect. }

		  gibt die Anfachung oder D\"ampfung der St\"orung, je

		  thickness and mantle viscosity on surface motions on a
		  spherical, self-gravitating, incompressible viscoelastic
		  earth are investigated using the Coupled Laplace-Finite
		  Element Method. The ICE-4G deglaciation model is used
		  together with gravitationally self-consistent sea levels in
		  realistic oceans to describe the load. Lateral variations
		  in mantle viscosities and lithospheric thickness are
		  inferred from seismic tomography model S20A using well
		  known scaling relationships. The laterally homogeneous
		  background viscosity has viscosity increases across 670km
		  and 1330km depths and is a simplification of Peltier's VM2
		  model. The effect of interaction between ice complexes in
		  North America, Greenland, Eurasia and Antarctica are
		  investigated and found to be significant for tangential
		  motion. The predicted motion in Laurentide and Antarctica
		  are also compared with results obtained with flat-earth
		  models and found that there is general agreement between
		  the two types of modeling although spherical earth models
		  are more realistic because they take into account the
		  interaction between ice complexes and there is no problem
		  with edge effects. The effects of lateral heterogeneity on
		  uplift rate are found to be large enough to be resolved by
		  current GPS technology. It confirms that the effect of the
		  reverse viscosity contrast in the transition zone under the
		  Laurentian and Fermoscandian craton may mask the effect of
		  lateral heterogeneity in the neighboring layers on uplift
		  rate. For tangential motion, lateral heterogeneity is found
		  to be able to overprint the divergent motion from the
		  centers of rebound predicted in laterally homogeneous
		  models. This finding is new for Laurentide and is due to
		  the contribution from the deep part of the lower mantle -
		  although the contribution from the upper mantle is also
		  important on tangential motion, its effects are compromised
		  by the effects from the other layers. (c) 2006 Elsevier

		  found for pressure-driven fluid flow through a circular
		  pipe. They consist of three well-defined flow features --
		  streamwise rolls and streaks which dominate and
		  streamwise-dependent wavy structures. The travelling waves
		  can be classified by the $m$-fold rotational symmetry they
		  possess about the pipe axis with $m = 1,2,3,4,5$ and $6$
		  solutions identified. All are born out of saddle-node
		  bifurcations with the lowest corresponding to $m = 3$ and
		  traceable down to a Reynolds number (based on the mean
		  velocity) of 1251. The new solutions are found using a
		  constructive continuation procedure based upon key physical
		  mechanisms thought generic to wall-bounded shear flows. It
		  is believed that the appearance of these new alternative
		  solutions to the governing equations as the Reynolds number
		  is increased is a necessary precursor to the turbulent
		  transition observed in experiments.}",

		  can account for a Newtonian, constant viscosity mantle. It
		  is suggested that small strain, transient creep and not

		  large creep strains, conclusions about the effective
		  viscosity of mantle rock undergoing such flow that is based
		  on isostatic rebound data are likely to be wrong. If Post's
		  and Carter & Mercier's laboratory results of the stress

		  representative of the actual grain sizes in the mantle,
		  power law creep is almost certainly the creep law that

		  rheology of the mantle is linear or non-linear, the aim of
		  this paper is to constrain mantle reology from observations
		  related to the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)
		  process-namely relative sea-levels (RSLs), land uplift rate
		  from GPS and gravity-rate-of-change from GRACE. We consider
		  three earth model types that can have power-law rheology (n
		  = 3 or 4) in the upper mantle, the lower mantle or
		  throughout the mantle. For each model type, a range of A
		  parameter in the creep law will be explored and the
		  predicted GIA responses will be compared to the
		  observations to see which value of A has the potential to
		  explain all the data simultaneously. The coupled Laplace
		  finite element (CLFE) method is used to Calculate the
		  response of a 3D spherical self-gravitating viscoelastic
		  Earth to forcing by the ICE-4G ice history model with ocean
		  loads in self-gravitating oceans. Results show that ice
		  thickness in Laurentide needs to increase significantly or
		  delayed by 2 ka, otherwise the predicted uplift rate,
		  gravity rate-of-change and the amplitude of the RSL for
		  sites inside the ice margin of Laurentide are too low to be
		  able to explain the observations. However, the ice
		  thickness elsewhere outside Laurentide needs to be slightly
		  modified in order to explain the global RSL data outside
		  Laurentide. If the ice model is modified in this way, then
		  the results of this paper indicate that models with
		  power-law theology in the lower mantle (with A similar to
		  10(-35) pa(-3) S-1 for n = 3) have the highest potential to
		  simultaneously explain all the observed RSL, uplift rate
		  and gravity rate-of-change data than the other model types.

  abstract	= {{A hundred Years ago, in his 1903 volume 11 of the
		  monograph devoted to `Theorie Analytique de In Chaleur',
		  Joseph Valentin Boussinesq observes that: ``The variations
		  of density can be ignored except were they are multiplied
		  by the acceleration of gravity in equation of motion for
		  the vertical component of the velocity vector.{''} A
		  spectacular consequence of this Boussinesq observation
		  (called, in 1916, by Rayleigh, the `Boussinesq
		  approximation') is the possibility to work with a
		  quasi-incompressible system of coupled dynamic, (Navier)
		  and thermal (Fourier) equations where buoyancy is the main
		  driving force. After a few words on the life of Boussinesq
		  and on his observation, the applicability of this

  abstract	= {{We investigate large Rayleigh number (10(6)-10(9)) and
		  large Prandtl number (10(2)-10(3)) thermal convection in
		  glycerol in an aspect ration one cubic cell. The kinematic
		  viscosity of the fluid strongly depends upon the
		  temperature. The symmetry between the top and bottom
		  boundary layers is thus broken, the so-called
		  non-Boussinesq regime. In a previous paper Wu and Libchaber
		  have proposed that in such a state the two thermal boundary
		  layers adjust their length scales so that the mean hot and
		  cold temperature fluctuations are equal in the center of
		  the cell. We confirm this equality. A simplified
		  two-dimensional model for the mean center temperature based
		  on an equation for the thermal boundary layer is presented
		  and compared with the experimental results. The conclusion
		  is that the central temperature adjusts itself so that heat
		  fluxes from boundaries are equal, temperature fluctuations
		  at the center symmetrical, at a cost of very different
		  temperature drops and Rayleigh number for each boundary.
