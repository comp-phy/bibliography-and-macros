This project shall be used as a share library for all LaTeX documents.

* vit-prusa-macros-experimental.tex
This is the file that contains macros for frequently used LaTeX constructs. (Especially in continuum mechanics.) This global should not be a subject fro frequent changes, if there is a need to redefine a macro, it should be done on the local level (i.e. in a new macro file in the project directory) using \renewcommand command.

* vit-prusa.bib
This is the bibliography file. It is maintained by the bibtool script, see file make.sh. Once you add an entry to the bibliography, the bibliography must be rebuilt using bibtool.

* print/vit-prusa-bibliography.tex
Compiling this file in LaTeX creates a document where all bibliography referencese are printed alphabetically.
